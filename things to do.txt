average of motions of still/tippy toe orientations. during run, if min angle of static => min angle normal, wrong.
the average min angle of the statics should be saved to compared to the actual angles


have to get isolated linear acceleration of arm swings
have baseline: over a specific amount of time, over specific distance (angular distance), x and y acceleration
interpolate over differnt time and different angular distance (larger angle for ex when runnig faster), get x and y acc
(only really care about x and y axis)

subtract lin acc from isolated arm swings from normal run lin acc
(only really care about x and y axis)


FOCUS:

INSTEAD OF CUTTING THE DATA YOURSELF, INPUT THE WHOLE DATA WITH A SPEED FILTER (TAKE DATA IF MOVING)
KEEP THE WHOLE FILE, JUST DON'T ADD TO TEH PEAKS!


FOR ACCELERATION ISOLATION:

CAN USE TIPPY TOE STATIC INFO TO ISOLATE X-AXIS LIN ACC SINCE NOT MOVING HORIZONTALLY. CAN'T DO Y-AXIS CAUSE JUMPING UP AND DOWN




THOUGHTS:

sincee left arm movement is very significant, maybe look at linear acceleration of right foot when left arm is in line with body.
