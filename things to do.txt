average of motions of still/tippy toe orientations. during run, if min angle of static => min angle normal, wrong.
the average min angle of the statics should be saved to compared to the actual angles


have to get isolated linear acceleration of arm swings
have baseline: over a specific amount of time, over specific distance (angular distance), x and y acceleration
interpolate over differnt time and different angular distance (larger angle for ex when runnig faster), get x and y acc
(only really care about x and y axis)

subtract lin acc from isolated arm swings from normal run lin acc
(only really care about x and y axis)
